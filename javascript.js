/*  // Initial Plan (ongoing changes)
    // 1. Create a var that stores all the book objects (in array object)
    
    // 2. Book constructor that will have the following properties
        * title of book
        * author of the book
        * number of pages
        * status if user has read or not
    
    // 3. `addBook()` will display a form where user inputs this data
        *  Use a `dialog` show a popbox that presents a form
        *  Create a html form (in js or html?) used the properties from the Book constructor
        *  Form will have a submit button and refresh button.
            * if user selects submit button it will close the `dialog`
            * if user selects refesh button it will remove all existing text in the form    

    // 4. `displayBook()` will display the inputed form into one of the cards
        * use if else statement to check if a user has read or not
        * if user has read it will move into the completed card else move to the ongoing card section
